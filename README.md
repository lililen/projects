Hi, so I currently have 2 projects that I shared on my resume. I started to self-learn coding a few months before the summer of 2024 and recently switched from Psychology Pre-Med 
Computer Science. Therefore I am currently a first year CS student and 3rd year undergrad student. Below I will explain the usage for my projects and the inspiration for them.

ProJ 1: Aim trainer.
I created this program after a series of watching videos of how to code in python. I was into rhythm games and wanted to practice on my aim and reaction as much as possible
which led me to write up the code for this project. This program will conjure up circles on random postions on the screen. You would try to click as many as possible and 
as closest to the center as possible too! At the end, it would show your accuracy score and your final score that you got. 

ProJ 2: Phubbing.
This program was inspired by a psychology research lab that I was starting this Fall quarter. The main topics for the lab is the rejeection mind set and phubbing. 
Phubbing is the act that one is distracted from the quality activity spent with their partner in favor of their phones or electronic devices. 
This Project would measure if the participant is phubbing or not by ultizing OpenCV for webcam and Pillow library to process the image/face recongiction for data. 
Pubbing would begin as soon as the participants look straight at the camera whereas looking away would mean they are focus on task. 
The draft of this project is finished however there is many limitations such that a partipant can be distracted without looking into the camera/electronic devices. Another 
limitation is the image processing is not ver accurate as looking slightly sideways can still count as phubbing and vice versa. 
**The project is not used in research, this project was made solely out of interest + watching a bunch of videos about ulitizing tkinker, pillow, openCV for webcam video and 
image capturing.
